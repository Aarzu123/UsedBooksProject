# UsedBooksProject
Used books sale – Team 5 Project statement

During the pandemic, many people were staying home and working from home. With 
them having more free time than before, most of them started building a new hobby of 
reading books. After finishing reading the books, they want to share the books with others 
and get another book for themselves.

So, create an application where users can sell the books which they have completed 
reading and purchase books which they have on their reading list.
Project Milestones (common for all):

● Complete web application having front end, backend and database 
integration.
